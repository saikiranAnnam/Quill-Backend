Step 1 - The Stack

I will be building the Medium Clone application in the following stack

1. React.js -- frontend
2. Cloudfare Workers -- backend (serverless functions)
3. zod as a validation library, type interface for the frontend types (validation)
4. Typescript -- programming language
5. Prisma as the ORM, with connection pooling ** 
6. Postgress  as the database
7. JWT for authenication

Step 2 - Initialize the backend

When we are building a project, usually the first thing we  should do is initialise the project’s backend.

Create a new folder called medium

mkdir medium
cd medium

Initialize a hono based cloudflare worker app 

npm create hono@latest

Target directory › backend
Which template do you want to use? - cloudflare-workers
Do you want to install project dependencies? … yes
Which package manager do you want to use? › npm (or yarn or bun, doesnt matter)
